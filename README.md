# C-Data-Structures
Learning 'bout them data structs.

This repository is intended as an overview of all the code I had to write for a Data Structures class. It includes classwork, homework, and the rare project for the class. The individual folders each represent a unique assignment, which may or may not rely on the node.h file that is most likely not copied into each and every one of those folders. For the console applications to run properly, try putting the node.h file within the folder whose app you're testing to see if it runs (or the nodeT.h file, for tree nodes).
